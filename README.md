# _Description_
What motivated me to get a one page personal portfolio webiste?
Well the short answer is:
Having a site where you can be almost everywhere other of your medium(Github, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Medium and Whatsapp) is a good way to tell people who you are and what you can do and what you are working on. My personal website is more a curriculum, just like LinkedIn, still personal. 
Starting out with a small site like mine, means using predefined  libraries and customisable templates and still remain simple. The result of doing so is a good looking site which contains a lot of personal informations in a small amount of space and in a single page. Well, from here you can make yours even simpler and who knows beat me to the game.
 
#_Content Interaction_
The project contains everything is needed and probably more below:
  ## Features 
- The single page layout with 4 sections (introduction, skills, projects, additional informations). Rearranging the content should be easy enough.
- The needed css, easily customizable and commented.
- Some javascript libraries, such as particles.js. You can easily customize particle.js, refer to the official site.
- Various images (which are meant to be replaced), including the favicon (the small image in the tab title).
- Responsive site based on an heavily modified html5up template.
- Customizable and simple layout.
- Customizable Particles.js!
- Animated logo, Fontawesome 5 icons.
- More to come...
  ## Usage
This is my (personal site)[www.chisomloius.ml], you have to replace some assets and configure the layout to your liking, just follow these steps.
- Clone the repository to your machine, or simply download as a zip and unzip it.
- The "core" of the site is the *index.html* file: here you will find the page layout.
- Replace the images in the /images folder with your profile pic, your projects and your site icon. I used an svg for my logo, but you can replace it with a png/jpg.
- Open app.js to customize particles.js. You can easily remove them, if you want. A little function changes the color scheme depending on the month. Removing or modifying it should be easy.
- To change the font and customize buttons, dimensions and so on, just open main.css and read the comments inside. If something is not commented and you don't know what you're doing, don't modify it!
-To test the site, just open the index.html in Chrome or in your favorite browser. Use the dev tools to show the mobile version, if you need it.
  ## Using the ML Domain
I use the .ml domain: it is free and renewable, you can learn more (here)[https://my.freenom.com/]. Regarding the hosting, you have a lot of potential options, but my advice is to use Firebase:

- First thing first, (sign up or login)[https://firebase.google.com/].
- Click on go to console.
- Start a new project.
- Open your new project and click on hosting.
- Now connect your personalized domain to the Firebase one.

Firebase is perfect for this kind of sites, in my opinion.
