## _Description_
> What motivated me to get a one page personal portfolio webiste?
Well the short answer is:
Having a site where you can be almost everywhere other of your medium(Github, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Medium and Whatsapp) is a good way to tell people who you are and what you can do and what you are working on. My personal website is more a curriculum, just like LinkedIn, still personal. 
Starting out with a small site like mine, means using predefined  libraries and customisable templates and still remain simple. The result of doing so is a good looking site which contains a lot of personal informations in a small amount of space and in a single page. Well, from here you can make yours even simpler and who knows beat me to the game.
 
## _Content Interaction_
The project contains everything is needed and probably more below:
  ### Features 
  - The single page layout with 4 sections (introduction, skills, projects, additional informations). Rearranging the content should be easy enough.
  - The needed css, easily customizable and commented.
  - Some javascript libraries, such as particles.js. You can easily customize particle.js, refer to the official site.
  - Various images (which are meant to be replaced), including the favicon (the small image in the tab title).
  - Responsive site based on an heavily modified [html5up](https://html5up.net/) template.
  - Customizable and simple layout.
  - Customizable [Particles.js!](https://github.com/chisomloius/my_test_web/blob/master/js/particles.js)
  - Animated logo, [Fontawesome 5 icons](https://fontawesome.com/).
  - More to come...
  ### Usage
  This is my [personal site](www.chisomloius.github.io), you have to replace some assets and configure the layout to your liking, just follow these steps.
  - Clone the repository to your machine, or simply download as a zip and unzip it.
  - The "core" of the site is the *index.html* file: here you will find the page layout.
  - Replace the images in the /images folder with your profile pic, your projects and your site icon. I used an svg for my logo, but you can replace it with a png/jpg.
  - Open app.js to customize particles.js. Removing or modifying it should be easy. A little function changes the color scheme depending on the month. 
  - To change the font and customize buttons, dimensions and so on, open main.css and read the comments inside. If something is unlcear to you, don't modify it!
  -To test the site, just open the index.html in Chrome or in your favorite browser. Use the dev tools to show the mobile version, if you need it.
  ### Using a Free Domain Name
 In this prject I used the *free github hositng service.* The instruction for usage can be found [here] (https://pages.github.com/).
  If you like to play around things, then choice from the many free website hosting platforms to get a domain name and connect it to firebase for proper hosting.
  You can follow the instructions to host on firebase:

  - First thing first, [sign up or login] (https://firebase.google.com/).
  - Click on go to console.
  - Start a new project.
  - Open your new project and click on hosting.
  - Now connect your personalized domain to the Firebase one.

  Firebase is perfect for this kind of sites, in my opinion. 
  *N.B: In the four other branches of this repository I will employed different codes and means of hosting.*
